# F. Angel
* This website is for anybody that is interested in the recipes that are shown here or wants to ask me an experience chef any specific questions or recipes. All recipes and described in detailed way so beginner cooks can make them without previous experience.

## UX
-----------------
### User Stories
* The website will help people that are completely unexperienced in the kitchen to prepare simple to more complex recipes, with very clear and direct explanation of what needs to be one, also on how to clean or cut the ingredients for preparation of the dish. Also allowing the user to contact me for any questions on recipes that are not on the site, but also about any other kitchen related things.
* This website is also useful for advance chefs or people that are just looking for a recipe and have previous experience.
* Both groups of people I spoke to had the same complains about the websites that are out online at the moment. 
* There are too many commercials or pop ups every time you open one on your phone or on pc. 
* They write a big story about the recipe or where it came from and most of times is not clear when the actual recipe starts or what needs to be done, there is too much going around.
* Giving a clear view of where are the recipes and if the person is interested to learn about the chef there is an about me page.

## Design
### Fonts
I chose to use [Castoro](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Castoro?query=casto) for all my pages, only changing 2 main sentences on my [About Me](https://github.com/AngelEyeLife/Felipe-Recipes/blob/master/about-me.html) with the standard Sans-serif.
### Colours
I chose these colours for the Main title since it emphasizes heat or fire like in the kitchen: 

![Title palette](assets/images/color-palette/fire-title.png)

Choose this colour for the navbar since it make sit stand out from the background:

![Navbar palette](assets/images/color-palette/navbar-items.png)

I like the titles to stand out more so is clear where you are on the page.

### Wireframes
* [Main wireframe for the Project](https://github.com/AngelEyeLife/Felipe-Recipes/blob/master/wireframe/angels-recipes-wireframe.pdf)
#### Changes to Wireframes
There were a lot of changes done to the wireframe in the process of making the website.

Header for all pages and background changes:

* The background change to a flame only, and to show only on the top with the title of the page and the navbar on the left side of the screen.
* Title has been made like is on fire and also an animation was added to the background so it looks like itâ€™s a live.
* The navbar has been simplified to be only letter since I wanted to have more view on the background, and changing the colors to be easily seen on the background.
* There was a discussion over the navbar, to make is all vertical or horizontal. I choose the vertical since it looks good on all platforms, and like to have that space in the middle.
* The background is kept white for the rest of the page so the emphasis is on the food and recipes.
Footer changes:

* Decided to make only the social media side of the footer since is more of a personal site, and I want to share my ideas with everyone.
* Content has been centered on the bottom of the page.

Contact page:

* The content has been centered on the page so on big screens it will always be easy to see and not a big white open space on one side.

About me page:

* Decided to put a chef picture of my self as to show me in uniform to make it more inviting.
* The text has 2 sentences that have quotes and emphasis to make them stand out since those are the reason, I love cooking.

Recipe page:

* Diced to switch the list style recipe view to a simpler and with more impact on the user.
* There are images that show the final product, and a small but simple description with it summarizing the recipe.
* Decided to make it with modals: 
    * This have been made larger do is easier to read the whole recipe without having to scroll so much on a page.
    * There is again the final product picture on top of the modal.
