# F. Angel
* This website is for anybody that is interested in the recipes that are shown here or wants to ask me an experiencee chef any specific questions or recipes. All recipes and described in detailed way so begginer cooks can make them without previous experience.

## UX
-----------------
### User Stories
* The website will help people that are completly unexperience in the kitcchen to prepare simple to more complex recipes, with very clear and direct explanation of what needs to be one, also on how to clean or cut the ingridients for preparation of the dish. Also allowing the user to contact me for any questions on recipes that are not on the site, but also about any other kitchen related things.
* This website is also usefull for advancce chefs or people that are just looking for a reccipe and have previous experience.
* Both groups of people I spoke to had the same complains about the websites that are out online at the moment. 
* There are too many commecials or pop ups every time you open one on your phone or on pc. 
* They write a big story about the recipe or where it came from and most of times is not clear when the actual reccicpe starts or what needs to be done, there is too much going around.
* Giving a clear view of where are tyhe recipes and if the person is interested to learn about the chef there is an about me page.
