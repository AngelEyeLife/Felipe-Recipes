            <p>Hello, my name is Felipe Angel and I dedicate my self to cooking as my career choice.
                My love for cooking came from my family and from some of my favorite memories of them, I am half
                Colombian half Italian, so you would understand from both sides of those cultures, family is very
                important.</p>

            <p>My mother side is Italian, so every time we went over to my Grandmothers house there was always food on
                the table or something would be made, my grand mother would be last to sit down or even at times eat
                standing up jut to make sure every one had what they wanted and eat enough, or more than enough because
                there was always an abundance of food.</p>

            <p>My father is Colombian, and what I remember a lot is the many BBQ we prepared together the day before or
                2 days before, we always ended up preparing more than we have to because we tended to eat while making
                things, so had to make more always.</p>

            <p>I have been working as a cook since 2018 when I moved here to The Netherlands, since then I have worked
                in several places, and learned a lot from different people, also I gained a mentor in the cooking
                industry which has helped me push to the level I am in and trying to go higher.</p>

            <p>The places I have worked have been, The Royal Theater Carr√© Netherlands, Victoria Hotel, Hotel Okura,
                One Micheline star restaurant Bridges, Sheraton Schiphol, Double Tree by Hilton and Park Inn by
                Radisson.</p>

            <p>The recipes I will be placing her eon the site are ones that I learned a long the years, some of this
                recipe I have changed a little bit for my own taste, but also let me remind you that in the kitchen you
                can always change the recipe if it fits your taste.</p>

            <p>The only part of the kitchen that needs to be exact is pastry, since the end result will be different if
                something is change and the recipe is not modified based on what you added or took away.</p>

            <p>I hope you enjoy the recipes like I have until now, and if you are looking for a recipe and is not here
                please contact me and I will get back at you as soon as possible.</p>
